## Quickstart with Docker

From the root of the project (where `docker-compose.yml` lives):

1. **Start up any running containers**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build

2. **Verify all three are Up**
    ```bash
    docker-compose ps

## Test

**Each application exposes its OpenAPI docs at:**

- App1: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html

- App2: http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui/index.html
